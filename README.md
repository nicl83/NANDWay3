# NANDWay3
A rewrite of NANDWay in Python 3.

This is a lazy re-write of NANDWay - originally a Python 2 script - in Python 3.
It requires Python 3.10 or later and PySerial.

I have written this with Pylint as my guide - I squished bugs until Pylint stopped screaming at me, then I shipped it.
I do NOT have the hardware to do road-tests of this script. It SHOULD match the behaviour of the Python 2 version, however I cannot guarantee it does.
***You use this script at your OWN RISK.*** (Something something thermonuclear war.)

I was asked to upload this to GitHub at 1am about two months after I initially wrote it,
and I believe I was part-way through a more comprehensive PEP8 compliant re-write when I was interrupted by IRL commitments,
so I'm including two versions of the code.

`NANDWay3.py` is the in-progress PEP8 rewrite. It is probably the more unstable of the two.
`NANDWay3_dcord.py` is an older pre-rewrite version. It is likely more stable, but is uglier and Pylint doesn't like it very much.

I will happily take a look at bug reports, however please remember that I do not have the original hardware.
